# Repository Operation Rules

These rules govern people and coding agents working in this repository. They
define the minimum delivery boundary; repository-specific documentation may add
stricter requirements.

## Sources of truth

Before changing code, identify and read the authoritative product, architecture,
API, development, security, and testing documentation that applies to the task.
Do not treat an old proposal, example, fixture, or pull request description as a
current contract when a maintained source exists.

When behavior or a public contract changes, update its authoritative document in
the same pull request. Examples include API routes and schemas, persisted domain
fields, supported commands, environment variables, migration steps, and user-
visible workflows. Do not document speculative behavior as implemented.

## Starting work

1. Inspect repository instructions and `git status`.
2. Update local knowledge of the target branch without discarding local changes.
3. Confirm the issue, acceptance criteria, dependencies, and permitted scope.
4. Create or use a focused branch. Do not work directly on a protected branch.
5. Preserve unrelated changes and secrets. Never copy credentials into commits,
   logs, pull request text, fixtures, or documentation.

## Issues and pull requests

Every pull request must reference at least one issue in its description. Use a
closing keyword such as `Closes #123` only when merging the pull request fully
satisfies that issue. Use `Refs #123` when it contributes without completing the
issue. Do not claim closure for acceptance criteria that remain unfinished.

Keep each pull request reviewable and aligned to one coherent outcome. State the
behavioral change, contract or migration impact, test evidence, and known limits.
Draft pull requests remain Draft until a person explicitly authorizes changing
their state. New commits after review require the affected checks and review to
be reconsidered.

## Local and remote quality gates

Run the commands in `.github/pr-quality-gate.yml` before pushing. A local
pre-push hook is an early warning, not the enforcement boundary. Required GitHub
Actions checks are the shared, auditable gate and must block merging when they
fail or are missing.

Do not bypass, rename, disable, or weaken a required check to make a pull request
green. Fix the implementation or update the documented contract through normal
review. Record the exact commands and meaningful results in the pull request;
do not assert user outcomes that the tests did not exercise.

## Review and authority

Review against the issue, current contracts, code, tests, and actual check runs.
Use `Approve` only when the pull request is ready to merge under those sources.
Use `Request changes` for concrete correctness, safety, contract, or acceptance
failures. Comments alone do not replace a blocking review when a blocker exists.

Coding agents may prepare changes, push an authorized branch, open or update a
pull request, comment, request changes, or approve when asked and permitted.
They must not perform any of the following without explicit authorization for
that exact action:

- merge a pull request;
- change a pull request between Draft and Ready;
- close or reopen an issue or pull request;
- alter branch protection, rulesets, required checks, or repository permissions;
- publish a release or deploy to an external environment.

Force-pushing is prohibited. Destructive Git commands and history rewrites are
also prohibited unless a repository owner gives explicit, narrowly scoped
authorization and a recovery plan exists.

## Exceptions

An emergency or tool failure does not silently waive these rules. Document the
failed gate, impact, decision owner, approved exception, and follow-up work. A
person with repository authority must make the exception; an agent cannot grant
itself broader authority.
